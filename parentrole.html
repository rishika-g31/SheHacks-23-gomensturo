      <h3><b>How to support for early puberty?</b><br><br>
      In cases where your daughter has started puberty before everyone else in her circle, it can be hard to gauge how to go about it. What is it that you can do when your daughter gets her period early? You need to look for the best ways to support your daughter in every way especially through the emotional upheaval that she would be going through at that young age. The most important thing is to talk to her about it and make her aware of the gradual changes happening to her body and reassure her that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with her.

      <b>How to support for late puberty?</b><br><br>
      This is an age where children are easy to get affected by friends around them. As your daughter will see all her friends developing, and she not being there yet, it might have an emotional impact on her. Talk to her at length and assure her that there is nothing wrong with her and even if she is late, she is in a better position because by now she would have heard stories of her friends and their experiences. Her friends will also be able to help her through her first period when the day comes. So, there is nothing to worry about. Remind her that we all end up in the same place - as strong, conﬁdent adults. How and when she gets there is part of the magic that she holds within her!

     Being a friend to your daughter at this stage is crucial. Engage in daily conversations with her, get to know her friends, and ask for her opinion on various matters. Spend quality time with her and make it comfortable for her to share her feelings.<br></li>
     <br><li><b>Be a Guide</b><br><!--Bold-->
     Do not try to control your daughter, instead be a guide who would help her make the right choices. Let her make mistakes and learn, but be there to guide when she asks for it.<br></li>
     <br><li><b>Healthy Perspective</b><br><!--Bold-->
