    <p>
        <div class="container" > <h2>Foods to eat</h2></div><br>
        <h3><div class="heading_"><li> Water</li><br> </div><div class="shift_left">
            Drinking a lot of water is always important, and this is especially true during your period. Staying hydrated can reduce your chances of getting dehydration headaches, a common symptom of menstruation.
            Drinking plenty of water can also stop you from retaining water and bloating.<br></div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Fruit</li><br></div><div class="shift_left">
            Water-rich fruits, such as watermelon and cucumber, are great for staying hydrated. Sweet fruits can help you curb your sugar cravings without eating a lot of refined sugars, which can cause your glucose levels to spike and then crash.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Leafy green vegetables</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
            It’s common to experience a dip in your iron levels during your period, particularly if your menstrual flow is heavy. This can lead to fatigue, bodily pain, and dizziness.
            Leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach can boost your iron levels. Spinach is also rich in magnesium.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Ginger</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
            A warm mug of ginger tea can improve certain symptoms of menstruation. Ginger has anti-inflammatory effects, which can soothe achy muscles.
            Ginger may also reduce nausea. Few studies confirm this, but a 2018 study found that ginger effectively reduced nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Since it’s safe and relatively cheap, it’s worth trying.
            Don’t consume too much ginger, though: Consuming more than 4 grams in one day could cause heartburn and stomachaches.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Chicken</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
            Chicken is another iron- and protein-rich food you can add to your diet. Eating protein is essential for your overall health, and it can help you stay full and sated during your period, curbing cravings.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Fish</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
            Rich in iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, fish is a nutritious addition to your diet. Consuming iron will counteract the dip in iron levels that you might experience while menstruating.
            Omega-3s can reduce the intensity of period pain, according to a 2012 study. Subjects who took omega-3 supplements found that their menstrual pain decreased so much that they could reduce the amount of ibuprofen they took.
            A 2014 study showed that omega-3s can also reduce depression. For those who experience mood swings and depression around menstruation, omega-3s may be helpful.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Turmeric</li></div></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><div class="shift_left">
            Turmeric is known as an anti-inflammatory spice, and curcumin is its main active ingredient. A 2015 study looked at the effects of curcumin on PMS symptoms and found that people who took curcumin had less severe symptoms.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Dark chocolate</li><br><div class="shift_left">
            A tasty and beneficial snack, dark chocolate is rich in iron and magnesium. A 100-gram bar of 70 to 85 percent dark chocolate contains 67 percent of the recommended daily intake (RDI) for iron and 58 percent of the RDI for magnesium.
            A 2010 studyTrusted Source found that magnesium reduced the severity of PMS symptoms. According to a 2015 studyTrusted Source, people with magnesium deficiencies were more likely to have severe PMS symptoms.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li> Nuts</li><br><div class="shift_left">
            Most nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and they’re a great source of protein. They also contain magnesium and various vitamins. If you don’t want to eat nuts on their own, try nut butters or nut-based milks or add these ingredients to smoothies.<br>
        </div>
            <div class="heading_"><li>Flaxseed oil</li> <br><div class="shift_left">
            Every 15 milliliters of flaxseed oil contains 7,195 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids. For perspective, the Office of Dietary Supplements says you need only about 1,100 to 1,600 milligramsTrusted Source of omega-3s per day.
            A small study found that consuming flaxseed oil soothed constipation, a common symptom of menstruation. However, more research is needed to show how flaxseed oil can improve digestive health.<br>
        </div>    </p></ul></h3>
            
        <div class="container" ><h2>Foods to aviod</h2><br></div>
               <h3> <div class="heading_"><li>Salt</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
                Consuming lots of salt leads to water retention, which can result in bloating. To reduce bloating, don’t add salt to your foods and avoid highly processed foods that contain a lot of sodium.<br></div>
        
               <div class="heading_"><li>Sugar</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
               It’s OK to have sugar in moderation, but eating too much of it can cause a spike in energy followed by a crash. This can worsen your mood. If you tend to feel moody, depressed, or anxious during your period, watching your sugar intake can help regulate your mood.<br></div>
        
               <div class="heading_"><li>Coffee</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
               Caffeine can cause water retention and bloating. It can also exacerbate headaches. But caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches, too, so don’t cut out coffee completely if you’re used to having a few cups a day.
               Coffee might also cause digestive issues. If you tend to get diarrhea during your period, reducing your coffee intake could stop this from happening.<br></div>
        
               <div class="heading_"><li>Alcohol</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
               Alcohol can have a number of negative effects on your body, which can exacerbate the symptoms of your period.
               For example, alcohol can dehydrate you, which can worsen headaches and cause bloating. It can also lead to digestive issues, such as diarrhea and nausea.<br></div>
        
               <div class="heading_"><li>Spicy foods</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
              Many people find that spicy foods upset their stomachs, giving them diarrhea, stomach pain, and even nausea. If your stomach struggles to tolerate spicy foods or if you’re not used to eating them, it might be best to avoid them during your period.<br></div>
        
               <div class="heading_"><li>Red meat</li></div><br><div class="shift_left">
              During your period, your body produces prostaglandins. These compounds help your uterus contract and get rid of the uterine lining, resulting in your menstrual flow. However, high levels of prostaglandins cause cramps.
              Red meat may be high in iron, but it is also high in prostaglandins and should be avoided during menstruation.</div>
