    <ol>
       <h3 id="abc"> 
        <li>Wash your hands before and after using a tampon. This will help reduce the spread of bacteria.
        Only use tampons when you have your period. Tampons are not intended to be used at any other time or for any other reason.</li>
        <li>Change each tampon every 4 to 8 hours. Never wear a single tampon for more than 8 hours at a time.</li>
        <li>Use the lowest absorbency tampon needed. If you can wear one tampon up to eight hours without changing it, the absorbency may be too high.</li>
       <li>Contact your health care provider if you have pain, fever or other unusual symptoms. If you have discomfort, pain or other unexpected symptoms like unusual discharge when trying to insert or wear a tampon, or if you have an allergic reaction, stop using tampons and contact your provider.</li><br>
